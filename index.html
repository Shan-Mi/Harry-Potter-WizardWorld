      Oh,you may not think I'm pretty,
      But don't judge on what you see,
      I'll eat myself if you can find
      A smarter hat than me.
      You can keep your bowlers black,
      Your tops hats sleek and tall,
      For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
      And I can cap them all.
      There's nothing hidden in your head
      The Sorting Hat can't see,
      So try me on and I will tell you
      Where you ought to be.
      Y ou might belong in Gryffindor,
      Where dwell brave of heart,
      Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
      Set Gryffindors apart;
      You might belong in Hufflepuff,
      Where they are just and loyal,
      Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
      And unafraid of toil;
      Or yet wise old Ravenclaw,
      If you've a ready mind,
      Where those of wit and learning,
      Will always find their kind;
      Or perhaps in Slytherin
      You'll make your real friends,
      Those cunning folk use any means
      To achive their ends.
      So put me on! Don't be afraid!
      And you won't get in a flap!
      You're safe in my hands(though I have none)
      For I'm a Thinking Cap!!</pre>
